This site is required by the ending project of an [optional course of HUST](http://cshust.gitee.io/university_computer_foundation/). Asking professor for permission in case of long-term usage, I'm able to use frame and theme. If it's not enough, see another Homepage of QJR which written by pure html/css/js for this project.


## Theme and Frame
Use the theme [Vno Jekyll](https://github.com/onevcat/vno-jekyll), which mainly base on Gem, Django, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Look the footer for more detail information.
## Thanks to
Thanks to the permisson of professor meanwhile such excellent opensource theme created by @onevcat, I quickly took up the morden front development, by reading the source code and searching the theory.

## Apologize
Apologize for choosing such a [cource](http://cshust.gitee.io/university_computer_foundation/), since it shouldn't have chosen by a grade-three student. However, I have to study abroad when grade four and need to finish all the credit before grade four.
